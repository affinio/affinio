# Docs Archive

This archive keeps historical execution artifacts and superseded planning documents that are still useful as engineering record.

What belongs here:

- completed checklists
- completed pipelines
- superseded roadmaps
- historical TODO plans that informed implemented architecture

What does **not** belong here:

- active runbooks (operational docs)
- current architecture/contracts/guides
- current release process documents
