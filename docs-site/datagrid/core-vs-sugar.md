# When to use Core vs Sugar

Use Core if:
- you need a custom rendering layer
- you control viewport and overlays manually
- you integrate into a non‑Vue runtime
- you need deterministic Interaction Orchestration Engine control

Use Sugar if:
- you build a Vue application
- you want quick start
- you do not need direct `GridApi` wiring
