# Advanced Topics

Need to dive deeper? The GitHub documentation covers every internal detail:

- **Architecture & internals** – Shared state tree, pointer prediction, layering strategy.  
  <https://github.com/affinio/affinio/blob/main/docs/reference/architecture.md>

- **Controller API** – Imperative helpers, programmatic context menus, shortcuts, and debug tips.  
  <https://github.com/affinio/affinio/blob/main/docs/reference/controller.md>

- **Mouse prediction & heuristics** – Tune diagonal intent, delays, and guard rails.  
  <https://github.com/affinio/affinio/tree/main/packages/menu-core>

These deep dives stay in GitHub so the website can focus on quick onboarding.
